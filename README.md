Solutions in python of the book Introduction to Statistical Learning in R

In this repository I try to solve the exercises proposed by the authors of the book Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R. Since Python is my favorite language I am trying to solve these exercises in that language rather than R.

I am still doing the exercises of the book as my DS self-taught lessons so keep that in mind when you are reading the notebooks.

Please do not hesitate to contact me for any feedback. I am in this beautiful learning process.
